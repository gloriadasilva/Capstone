In the previous section, you learned how to create and nest components. In this section, you will learn how to import and export components in Refract.

## Import and Export Component

In Refract, components are usually defined in their own files so they can be reused across your project. To make a component available in other files, you **export** it. To use that component in another file, you **import** it.


## When to Import and Export Components

You should export a component whenever you want to reuse it outside the file where it was created. For example, if you build a Button component that will be used in different pages, you’ll export it once and import it wherever you need it.

On the other hand, if a component is used only inside the same file (for example, a tiny helper UI inside a bigger parent component), you don’t need to export it.

## How to Import and Export Components

The most common way is to use **default export** and **default import**.

Button.jsx
``` jsx showLineNumbers
import { createComponent } from "refract";
const Button = createComponent(({ lens }) => {
  return <button>{lens.props.label}</button>;
});
export default Button;

```

App.jsx

``` jsx showLineNumbers
import { createComponent } from "refract";
import Button from "./Button";

const App = createComponent(() => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <Button label="Click Me" />
    </div>
  );
});

export default App;
```
Here, Button is exported as the default from its file, and then imported into `App.jsx` for use.

## How to Import and Export Multiple Components From the Same File

Sometimes you might define more than one component in the same file. In this case, you can use named exports.

UI Component.js

``` jsx showLineNumbers
import { createComponent } from "refract";

export const Button = createComponent(({ lens }) => {
  return <button>{lens.props.label}</button>;
});

export const Card = createComponent(({ lens }) => {
  return <div className="card">{lens.props.children}</div>;
});
```

App.jsx

``` jsx showLineNumbers
import { createComponent } from "refract";
import { Button, Card } from "./UIComponents";

const App = createComponent(() => {
  return (
    <Card>
      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <Button label="Click Me" />
    </Card>
  );
});

export default App;
```
In this example, `Button` and `Card` are exported by name and then imported together with curly braces.
