## What are Props?

Props (short for properties) are how you pass data from one component to another in Refract. They work like parameters to a function—allowing components to be dynamic, reusable, and flexible.
Think of props as inputs: a parent component can pass information down to its children so that each child can render differently based on the given data.

## How to Pass a Prop to a Component

**1. Passing Props**

Props are written just like HTML attributes when you use a component:
``` jsx
const Greeting = createComponent(({ lens, props }) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
});

// Passing the prop
<Greeting name="John" />
```
Here, the `name` prop is passed to `Greeting`, and the component renders:
```
Hello, John!
```
**2. Multiple Props**

You can pass multiple props the same way:
``` jsx
const UserCard = createComponent(({ props }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{props.username}</h2>
      <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
    </div>
  );
});

// Passing multiple props
<UserCard username="Ada" age={24} />
````
**3. Props as Expressions**

Props don’t have to be static values; they can be JavaScript expressions:
``` jsx
const Today = createComponent(({ props }) => {
  return <p>Today’s date is {props.date}</p>;
});

<Today date={new Date().toDateString()} />
```
