# Introduction

## What is Refract

Refract is a fictional JavaScript framework designed to help developers build modern, scalable, and reactive user interfaces (UIs). "Reactive UIs" refers to the ability of an interface to respond to user interactions or changes in data.

With Refract, the entire webpage in your application does not need to reload entirely before displaying updated information. Only the part of the page that needs to be updated will be updated, which leads to faster load times and enhances the user's experience. 

## Advantages of Using Refract

**1. Reactive and Declarative State (Refractions)**:

In Refract, refractions are the building blocks of reactivity. They act like small, reactive containers of state that automatically update the UI when their value changes. Unlike traditional state management libraries, refractions are lightweight and built-in, so you donâ€™t need tools like Redux or MobX.

**2. Optimized Performance via Compiler:**

Refract ships with a lightweight compiler that optimizes your code before it runs in the browser. Instead of relying on runtime checks, the compiler can analyze data flow and generate efficient code paths. This ensures your app updates only where necessary, avoiding full component re-renders.

**3. Declarative Animation API:**

Instead of relying on external animation libraries, Refract includes a declarative animation API. Developers can describe transitions and effects in a clean, component-driven way.

**4.  Optical Composition for Reusability:**

Refract provides optics, which are reusable logic modules similar to React hooks but more powerful. Optics are dependency-aware and can handle transitions and animations natively.
Refract aims to provide a framework that is reactive, performant, and easy to scale, while keeping the developer experience simple and predictable.
